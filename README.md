# Forest-Fire-Prediction
A project code based on forest fire prediction with machine learning models has been used. On the basis of the parameters we have to predict the month in which forest fire can occur. This helps to find the parameters in a month in which forest fire can occur.
Machine learning model -
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
